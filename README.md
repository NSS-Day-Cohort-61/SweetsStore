# Madi's Sweets Shop

Madison Peper owns a sweets shop that sells brand name candies, and in-house baked goods. Madi wants a simple command line tool that will allow her to see all of the products that she sells on a daily basis. She hired her nephew to begin the development process, but he had to go off to college and couldn't complete the work. She hired you to complete the project and your payment will be free cookies for a year.

You must use your knowledge of inheritance to reduce the amount of duplicated properties and methods across all of the classes that her nephew designed, so that the code is more easily maintained and modified.
